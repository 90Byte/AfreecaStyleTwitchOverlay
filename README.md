This is a thing that shows things, uh... chat overlay or something.

You use it like this:
1. Get OBS or XSplit, Windows Movie Maker or whatever the fuck else you're using for your stream as long as it supports browser sources.
2. Put this as the URL:
`http://chat.mikuia.tv/?channel=YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME`
3. If you stream at 60 FPS, you can set the browser source FPS to 60 too, for extra smoothness.
4. That's it.

It looks something like this:
